# file-expert

An expert system for recognizing file types, similar to GitHub/linguist, but
written in Prolog.

## Usage

```shell
file-expert FILE…
```

The program can also read the files from `STDIN` like this:

```shell
git ls-files|file-expert
```

### Output Format

Each output line contains the filename and the file type separated by the tab
character.

#### Output Example

```
.gitignore      Ignore List
.gitlint.yaml   YAML
.gitmodules     Git Config
COPYING.md      Markdown
Makefile.am     Makefile

## History

Started around November 2017. Replaced with a Nim implementation in December
2018, because at this point the GitHub/linguist heuristics were a huge mess of
`if … else` Ruby spaghetti code.

This project was archived until January 2019. My Nim implementation was broken
by the compiler update. While fixing it I noticed that the GitHub/linguist
heuristics were refactored to a YAML file. This opened up the possibility to
easily autogenerate the heuristics rules. So I started working on the Prolog
implementation again.
